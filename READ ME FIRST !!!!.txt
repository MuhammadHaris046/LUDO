Simple Ludo Game in Python (Console-Based)
This is a basic console-based Ludo game developed using Python. It simulates the core logic of the traditional Ludo board game for two or more players. The game is text-based and runs in the terminal.

About the Project
I created this project to practice and apply fundamental Python programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, and basic game logic. It’s a simple implementation designed to be easy to understand and modify.

Features
Console-based gameplay

Dice roll simulation

Turn-based logic

Basic movement rules (no GUI)

How to Run
Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Clone or download the project files.

Open a terminal or command prompt
Note
This project is built for learning purposes and is a simplified version of the actual Ludo game. It doesn’t include full rules like capturing, safe spots, or full path movement.

Credits
Special thanks to Angel Angelov for the original concept inspiration.

About Me
I’m Muhammad Haris, and I enjoy building small console-based games like this to strengthen my programming foundations and explore how classic board games can be implemented in code.
